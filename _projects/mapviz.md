An outcome of my frustration of not finding simple online tools to visualization a list of geohashes and bearings. The project is structured in a way so that new features can be added easily.

## Notable Features
- Geohashes
- Bearings

WebPage: [MapViz](https://bhargavchippada.github.io/mapviz)

I am looking forward to add more features and any contributions are highly welcome. The project uses Reactjs and Google Maps Javascript API mainly. Look at FeaturesNav.js, Features.js and Bearings.js files to get an idea of how to add a new feature.
